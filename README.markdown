# pybloomfiltermmap

The goal of `pybloomfiltermmap` is simple: to provide a fast, simple, scalable,
correct library for Bloom Filters in Python.

This fork of the project fixes some issues when using a lot of these objects and/or 
an erroneous error message ;).

## Docs

You should probably read the original docs online at <http://mike.axiak.net/python-bloom-filter/docs/html/>

## Overview

After you install, the interface to use is a cross between a file
interface and a ste interface. As an example:

    >>> fruit = pybloomfilter.BloomFilter(100000, 0.1, '/tmp/words.bloom')
    >>> fruit.extend(('apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'apple'))
    >>> len(bf)
    3
    >>> 'mike' in fruit
    False

## Install

You may or may not want to use Cython. If you have it installed, the
setup file will build the C file from the pyx file. Otherwise, it will
skip that step automatically and build from the packaged C file.

To install:

   $ sudo python setup.py install

and you should be set.
